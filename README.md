🚀 Programming Fundamentals - Lab 06
📌 Overview:
This repository contains Lab 06 solutions from the Programming Fundamentals course at FAST NUCES  (Fall 2022).
The lab covers conditional structures (if-else, if-else-if ladder) in C++.

📂 Topics Covered
✅ If-Else Statements
✅ If-Else-If Ladder
✅ Logical Conditions (&&, ||, !)
✅ Nested If Conditions

📝 Lab Tasks
🟢 Task 01 - Sorting Three Numbers in Descending Order
Write a program that reads three integers from the user and prints them in descending order.

📌 Code: Q1.cpp

📌 Example Input:
  Enter three numbers: 3 0 7
📌 Expected Output:
  Descending order: 7 3 0

🟢 Task 02 - Discount Calculation
A shop gives a 10% discount if the total purchase value is more than Rs. 2000.
Write a program that asks the user for the total purchase value and displays:

Whether the discount is applicable or not
The final amount after discount
📌 Code: Q2.cpp

📌 Example Input:
  Enter the total purchase value: 10000
📌 Expected Output:
  Discount is applicable
  The total purchase value after discount is: 9000

  🟢 Task 03 - Temperature Classification
Write a program that reads the temperature in centigrade and displays a suitable weather condition based on the given scale:
  Temp < 0     → Freezing Weather  
  Temp 0-10    → Very Cold Weather  
  Temp 10-20   → Cold Weather  
  Temp 20-30   → Normal Temperature  
  Temp 30-40   → It's Hot  
  Temp >= 40   → It's Very Hot  

📌 Code: Q3.cpp

📌 Example Input:
  Enter temperature in centigrade: 42
📌 Expected Output:
  It's Very Hot

🟢 Task 04 - ASCII Sum of Second Name
Write a program that stores your second name as characters. Then, add the ASCII values of these characters and:

Print "Even" if the sum is even.
Print "Odd" if the sum is odd.
📌 Code: i220970_Q4.cpp

📌 Example Input:
  Name: AHMED
📌 Expected Output:
  Sum = 345
  The ASCII sum of AHMED is Odd.
